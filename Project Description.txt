The screenshots provided were the solution to the 
banker's algorithm homework as a demo and the code 
has ready inserted values for processes for the sake 
of time-saving but the code that allows you to insert 
your own values is provided as a comment.
the screenshots and code snippets required for the 
multithreading part of the project are in the word document
along with a paper showing the process of making the project.
